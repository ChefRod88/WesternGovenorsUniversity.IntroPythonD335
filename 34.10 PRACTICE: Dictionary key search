Create a Python solution to the following task. Ensure that the solution produces output in exactly the same format shown in the sample(s) below, including capitalization and whitespace.

Task:
Create a solution that accepts an integer input identifying how many shares of stock are to be purchased from the Old Town Stock Exchange, followed by an equivalent number of string inputs representing the stock selections. The following dictionary stock lists available stock selections as the key with the cost per selection as the value.

stocks = {'TSLA': 912.86 , 'BBBY': 24.84, 'AAPL': 174.26, 'SOFI': 6.92, 'KIRK': 8.72, 'AURA': 22.12, 'AMZN': 141.28, 'EMBK': 12.29, 'LVLU': 2.33}

Output the total cost of the purchased shares of stock to two decimal places.

The solution output should be in the format

Total price: $cost_of_stocks
Sample Input/Output:
If the input is

3
SOFI
AMZN
LVLU
then the expected output is

Total price: $150.53

# Define the available stocks and their costs
stocks = {
    'TSLA': 912.86,
    'BBBY': 24.84,
    'AAPL': 174.26,
    'SOFI': 6.92,
    'KIRK': 8.72,
    'AURA': 22.12,
    'AMZN': 141.28,
    'EMBK': 12.29,
    'LVLU': 2.33
}

# Accept the number of shares to be purchased
num_shares = int(input())

# Initialize total cost
total_cost = 0

# Loop to accept stock selections and calculate total cost
for _ in range(num_shares):
    stock_selection = input()
    if stock_selection in stocks:
        total_cost += stocks[stock_selection]

# Output the total cost formatted to two decimal places
print(f"Total price: ${total_cost:.2f}")
