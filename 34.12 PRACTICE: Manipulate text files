Create a Python solution to the following task. Ensure that the solution produces output in exactly the same format shown in the sample(s) below, including capitalization and whitespace.

Task:
Create a solution that accepts an input identifying the name of a text file, for example, "WordTextFile1.txt". Each text file contains three rows with one word per row. Using the open() function and write() and read() methods, interact with the input text file to write a new sentence string composed of the three existing words to the end of the file contents on a new line. Output the new file contents.

The solution output should be in the format

word1
word2
word3 
sentence
Sample Input/Output:
If the input is

WordTextFile1.txt
then the expected output is

cat
chases
dog
cat chases dog

file_name = input()

# Open the file in read and write mode
with open(file_name, "r+") as file:
    # Read three lines from the file (one word per line)
    words = [file.readline().strip() for _ in range(3)]
    
    # Form a sentence by joining the three words with spaces
    sentence = " ".join(words)
    
    # Move the cursor to the end and write the sentence on a new line
    file.write(f"\n{sentence}")
    
    # Move the cursor back to the beginning to read the updated file
    file.seek(0)
    
    # Output the entire file contents
    print(file.read())
