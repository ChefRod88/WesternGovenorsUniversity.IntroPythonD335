Create a Python solution to the following task. Ensure that the solution produces output in exactly the same format shown in the sample(s) below, including capitalization and whitespace.

Task:
Create a solution that accepts an integer input representing a 9-digit unformatted student identification number. Output the identification number as a string with no spaces.

The solution output should be in the format

111-22-3333
Sample Input/Output:
If the input is

154175430
then the expected output is

154-17-5430

#hint: modulo (%) and floored division (//) may be used
#solution accepts a 9-digit integer representing an unformatted student identification number (i.e.,"5417543010")
#solution outputs formatted student identification number as a string (i.e.,"541-75-3010")

student_id = input()

formatted_id = f"{student_id[:3]}-{student_id[3:5]}-{student_id[5:]}"

print(formatted_id)
