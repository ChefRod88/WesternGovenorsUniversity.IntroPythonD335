Create a Python solution to the following task. Ensure that the solution produces output in exactly the same format shown in the sample(s) below, including capitalization and whitespace.

Task:
Create a solution that accepts a string input representing a grocery store item and an integer input identifying the number of items purchased on a recent visit. The following dictionary purchase lists available items as the key with the cost per item as the value.

purchase = {"bananas": 1.85, "steak": 19.99, "cookies": 4.52, "celery": 2.81, "milk": 4.34}

Additionally,

If fewer than ten items are purchased, the price is the full cost per item.
If between ten and twenty items (inclusive) are purchased, the purchase gets a 5% discount.
If twenty-one or more items are purchased, the purchase gets a 10% discount.
Output the chosen item and total cost of the purchase to two decimal places.

The solution output should be in the format

item_purchased $total_purchase_cost
Sample Input/Output:
If the input is

bananas
12
then the expected output is

bananas $21.09

purchase = {"bananas": 1.85, "steak": 19.99, "cookies": 4.52, "celery": 2.81, "milk": 4.34}

item = input()
quanity = int(input())

if quanity < 10:
    discount = 0
    
elif 10 <= quanity <= 20:
    discount = 0.05
else:
    discount = 0.10
    
total_cost = purchase[item] * quanity * (1 - discount)
print(f"{item} ${total_cost:.2f}")
